1.1 Purpose

Looking at the current situation faced by farmers in Uttar Pradesh, we have observed that there is an increase in suicide rate over the years. The reasons behind this includes weather conditions, debt, family issues and frequent change in Indian government norms. Sometimes farmers are not aware about the crop which suits their soil quality, soil nutrients and soil composition. The work proposes to help farmers by providing them the required awareness about farming techniques and also help them to predict which is the most suitable crop for them according to their area. Thus the system focuses on creating awareness on farming methodsand to predict the crop suitable for cultivation according to their area and maximize the crop yield with recommending appropriate crop.
